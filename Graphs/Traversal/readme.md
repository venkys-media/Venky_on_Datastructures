# Graph Traversal Implementation

This folder contains implementations of graph traversal algorithms (BFS and DFS) in multiple programming languages.

## Description
The program demonstrates:
- Graph traversal using BFS (Breadth First Search)
- Graph traversal using DFS (Depth First Search)
- Adjacency list representation
- Visited node tracking

## Algorithm Steps
1. BFS:
   - Use queue for level-order traversal
   - Mark nodes as visited
   - Process neighbors level by level
2. DFS:
   - Use stack for depth-first traversal
   - Mark nodes as visited
   - Process neighbors depth-wise

## Features
- Both BFS and DFS implementations
- Undirected graph support
- Visited node tracking
- Queue/Stack based traversal

## Complexity Analysis
- Space Complexity: O(V) where V is number of vertices
- Time Complexity: O(V + E) where E is number of edges
